                        <h3><strong>Name:</strong> Sho Tanaka</h3>
                        <h4><strong>Profession:</strong> student & rec staff</h4>
                        <p>
                            I am a senior year student in Carleton College class of 2025. I declared as a Computer Science Major and I'm pursuing my passion for coding as software engineer and web developer. 
                            Over the past few years, I’ve worked hard in Carleton to grow academically and personally. 
                            I’m particularly interested in using developing something that will help people and better their life whether it is an useful app, entertaining activity, or new advanced technology no one has came up with.
                            Outside of academics, I enjoy spending time both outside and inside. Some of the outside activity I enjoy are playing sports like tennis, basketball, bowling, and snowbaording. On the other hand I also spend a lot of time inside playing video games or watching youtube and tik toks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As I prepare to graduate, I’m excited about the journey ahead and look forward to contributing meaningfully to the fields of technology and innovation.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        While I have not yet have any job experience as a software enginner I have had several job experiences such as , math tutor, tennis coach, and short intership at a engineer company for airplanes.
                        I believe that these experiences have allowed me to grow as a person teaching responsibility and discipline preparing me for a job as a sfotware engineer.

                        <strong>Project Description:</strong>
                        Many students at Carleton College have a problem in the final days of their senior year.
                        They find themselves with too many items, necessary for college life, to travel with or have items that they don’t want in their future. 
                        Their last days in the dorms are spent throwing lightly used and valuable items in Lighten up, the dumpster, or trying to pawn them off others. 
                        Our project will provide a platform that makes it easy for seniors, or Carleton students of any year, to put lightly used and new items onto the site for other Carleton students to buy, barter, or pick up for free.

                        <strong>Description of Figma Prototype:</strong>
                        Prototype addresses the user needs I learned about from the Fictional Inquary I performed with the seniors in Carleton.
                        Both seniors mentioned that a filter feature will be very useful for the user as it will allow them to look for desired items much easier. 
                        Therfore I included the filter feature at the left side which allows you to filter the price range of assignments and key items that most students may find useful such as furnitures and electronics.

                        Also one of the senior mentioned that at the home page of the store, it should show recommended items for user to take a look at based off of the usesrs search history and items bought.
                        I also added a feature to like/favorite an item in the store which allows you to keep track of items you want to come back for and possibly implement a recommendation algorithm that keeps them track for the recommendation section at the home page.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <br> <strong>First requirement:</strong> Buy Page. Buy page is a core function of the marketplace that allows the users to browse and purchase items. Without a functional buy page, users cannot make any purchase and engage with the platform meaningfully.
                        <br><strong>Second requirement:</strong> Shopping cart. A shopping cart is essential feature for user convenience, allowing users to collect and review items before purchasing. This allows the user to make a final check of what to buy and how much it will cost. If the user chnages their mind or see a item they never wanted, user can simply remove them.
                        <br><strong>Third requirement:</strong> Sell Page. A functional sell page is critical for sustaining marketplace supply; without sellers listing items, buyers have nothing to purchase. Being able to sell item is key for Carlmart as the whole purpose of Carlmart is to have students not waste products they don't need by trashing them but selling them.

                        <strong>The first video is the sell page video</strong> and you will be able to see how to navigate through the prototype of the sell page interaction. At the navigation bar at the top of the home page, you can click on the "sell" button to open the sell page that allows you to upload the image of your item you want to sell and set a price for it. This prototype addresses the crucial sell page requirement.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>The second video is the shopping cart video</strong> and you will be able to see how to navigate through the prototype of the shopping cart page. There is two ways to access the shopping cart page. One way is to go to the home page top navigation bar and click on "Cart" button to open up shop and be able to check whats in your purchase list or cart whenever you want to. The second way to view is when you click on the item you want to purchase, you will be sent to the product page and you when click on add to cart, it will add the item to the shopping cart and also take you to the shooping cart page. This addresses the requirement of shopping cart as it allows the user to see what they have purchased before they confirm and make payment of the item for the user's convenience.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>The third video is the buy page video</strong> and you will be able to see how to navigate through the prototype of the buy page. You can access the buy page at the home page that includes the as you can see the list of all the purchasable items currently. If you click on any of the picture of the item you want to purchase, it will open up the product page that includes all the information user would want to learn about the item such as the price, condition, image, etc. It allows you to add the item to your cart and purchase the item. This addresses the buy page requirement as it allows the user to select the item they want to buy and proceed with the process.

                        <strong>UX research process.</strong> Our team decided to focus on semi-structured interview and fictional inquiry interviews for our UX research process. We decided that these two methods would allow us to best find the informations and designs for our website based on what stakeholders believe it will be useful. We perffered this method one 1 on 1 conversation type over group interview like focus group so the stakeholders are comfortable talking about more personal stuff for our questions. Each of our team members conducted a semi-structured or fictional inquiry interview with different stakeholders and we used the information from them to create our codebook and final three requirements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Anaylsis Process.</strong> Our team's analysis process had six steps. Initial axial coding, affinity diagram, codebook, axial coding w/ codebook, consensus building, and requirements generation. We started off by creating an axial coding from the transcript of the interviews we did . We split into two groups and created an affinity diagram based on themes/sub-categories and code we saw in the transcripts, and made a consensus on each of our codebooks. Laslty, we worked on consensus building and requirements generation as a group to anaylze and combine all of our previous steps.

                        <strong>Interaction flow: </strong>
                        <br>Sell page interaction. You can access the sell page by navigating to the sell button on the navigation page at the home page.
                        <br>Shopping cart page interaction. There is two ways to access the shopping cart page. One way is to go to the home page top navigation bar and click on "Cart" button to open up shop and be able to check whats in your purchase list or cart whenever you want to.

                    <h3>Carlmart - UX Evaluation</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>UX Evaluation Overview.</strong> I perfomred a UX Evaluation on the prototpye of Carlmart design and the results were great for the first ever prototype.
                        I was able to receive a high rating of 4.5/5 from the two senior students of Carleton College who I had give me feedbacks while interacting and testing with my prototype.
                        Both of the students did not have much trouble going through the prototype and praised both my visual and features of the prototype.
                        They pointed out some key changes that should be made which I attempted to imporve immediately. However, the part of the UX Evaluation 
                        that did not work out as I expected would be how I conducted the evaluation with both the students at once as that was the UX Evaluation process.
                        I believe that this may have resulted to the point outs and feedback to be similar and repetative as the student that took a look of the prototype
                        heard the first students point and be drawn to them resulting on coming up with similar feedbacks. This made me realize that their are pros and cons on 
                        the method of UX Evaluation and it will be crucial for us to conduct several UX Evaluation with variety of methods for diverse feedbacks.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong> UX Evaluation Process.</strong>
                        For our method of UX Evaluation, we chose the think-aloud method where as we had our interviee navigate through our prototype while completing the tasks we assigned them,
                        they had to speak out loud all of their thought process. For example, one of the senior student A who I had him do a task, he was speaking out
                        loud, <strong> "okay, I would say cart here, yes, yes, these are all the items. So these three items cost $6 $13".</strong>  This allowed us to further analyze what the user
                        are looking at, find navigation patterns, and hear there thought process such as what they are expecting the prototype to have and where.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Short description of your UX evaluation tasks.</strong>
                        To the two senior students, I had them do three different tasks which includes the testing of the three requirement our decided on Carlmart will need for sure.
                        <br> <strong>Task One:</strong> The first task was to navigate to Buy Page by making a purchase of an item. This could be done by clicking on any image of the item that can be found in the home screen of Carlmart.
                        Then the user is navigated to the Buy Page that includes the item description before you put the item in your cart.

                        <br> <strong>Task Two:</strong> The second task was to navigate to your cart to check the items that you are currently trying to purchase and allow user to double check what they are buying before they select payment method and confirm their purchase.
                        You can navigate to the cart two ways. One way is to select the item you are trying to buy then click on add to cart which will add the item to the cart and navigate you to your cart to confirm that.
                        The second way is to simply navigate to cart from the home screen which the button is located at the top right in the navigation bar.

                        <br> <strong>Task Three:</strong> The third task was to navigate to sell page which allows you to sell the item you want to sell. 
                        You can navigate to the sell page by clicking on the sell button at the top right located in the navigation bar. This will take you to a page that is similar to the cart but includes the list of items you are currently selling waiting to be bought by others.
                        In order to navigate to the sell page and sell a new item, you will have to click on the button in the top right.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong> UX Evaluation Results</strong>.
                        From the UX Evaluation I was able to get valueable feedbacks. 
                        <br> <strong>Student A.</strong> Starting off with the feedback senior student A gave me. Student A noticed that the navigation bar needs to be improved. 
                        Student A pointed out that, <strong>"products shouldn't be if we're, oh, is this because we're on the products tab? Is that? Why is this? It's highlighted."
                            Student A realized that my navigation bar highlighted a button that is not in use so recommened me to get rid of buttons that are not in use and
                            highlight a important button which student A told me to, "If that's the case, maybe highlights the carts button. Yeah,"</strong>

                        <br> <strong>Student M.</strong> Senior student M shared her knowledge that home button,<strong>"it's a very convenient way 
                            to get to the home button, because logo is right there. It's nice and big and it's just yeah, a convenient way for people 
                            to always know where the home button is, even if like say you don't have actually like the title home." </strong> 
                        <br> Student M recommended me to make the Big logo at top right the home button as this is the most common way most of the websites use.
                        This ensures that the layout to be consistent allowing the user to be able to navigate back to home faster. Also it will visually 
                        improve the prototype since rather than having a home button that may not look appealing, it would be better to have the logo on all the
                        other pages not just at home page.

                        <br> <strong>UX Metrics</strong>
                        <br> <strong> Time on Task: How long it takes users to complete specific tasks </strong>

                        <br><strong>Task One:</strong>  Adding an item to the shopping cart/ Making a purchase
                        <br>Student A: 30 sec, Student M: 57 sec
                        
                        <br><strong>Task Two:</strong> Uploading an item for sale
                        <br>Student A: 120 sec, Student M: 90 sec
                        
                        <br><strong>Task Three:</strong> Checking what’s in your cart from home
                        <br>Student A: 10 sec, Student M: 5 sec

                        <br> <strong>Number of Errors</strong>
                        <br> <strong>Student A: 2 errors.</strong> Example error is when there was a confusioning button on the navigation bar that said Product, which made student A thought that the 
                        button would take him to the product page when that button had no functionality and pointed out that I should remove it.
                        
                        <br> <strong>Student M: 2 errors.</strong> Example error is  when student M thought the list of items you are currently selling is the items that are pending to be confirmed you want to 
                        sell, although I intended them to be the list of items that the user has already confirmed and are being sold. They thought clicking on the image of the 
                        items already being sold would allow them to confirm to sell them.

                        <br> Specifically, student M said, <strong>"items. I think so, because it's like, on the click to sell is on, like, the very top right, which is a little, I guess, harder to see, 
                        because my first thought would be like, like, putting it in the color, like, the same process, like, you click the item, and then you click, like, click to sell for that certain item," </strong>

                        <br> <strong> Incorporating Feedbacks</strong>
                        <br> The changes I made based on the user feedback includes changing the home button as the Carlmart logo on the top left as student M recommneded me to. This supports layout consistency and better visual looks
                        Then I fixed my navigation bar and got rid of unnecessary buttons then added a blue background for the sell button which is a important requirement we selected so user can spot them easier.

                    <h3>Future Steps</h3>
                    <p>
                        The future steps I would be making based on the feedback I received would be adding a payment screen. During the UX Evaluation, I had a procceed to payment button that 
                        does not navigate you to anywhere yet. I will have to set up the payment screen so that you could register your card or use other method such as venmo. While venmo could be possible since all 
                        we have to do is add the venmo username. However, not all user has venmo and it is very unprofessional for our payment method to be only venmo so it is crucial for us to allow user to be able to make purchase with cards which is far beyond figam prototype.
                        <br> Also user recommended me to add a message/texting feature so the seller and buyers could communicate which the figma prototype can not address but will need to be implemented. The chat option would allow the user to furhter learn about the items or make the process
                        of buying and selling more smooth and easy. Allowing users to send messages and communicate is something outside of figma prototpye which requires advanced coding skills.
